# Detect-Licensce-Plate

This is being made by following a Youtube Tutorial from 'Nicholas Renotte'. 

The video is Titled - Automatic Number Plate Recognition using Tensorflow and EasyOCR Full Course in 2 Hours | Python

NOTE -- 
I won't be doing the OCR part. 
My main aim is to learn object detection using tensorflow on annotated images and this tutorial was as a great starting point for this. 

The output of this project will be the bounding box to a license plate on a car. I will be using these learnings in my future projects.
